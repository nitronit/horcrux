# Glossary - WORK IN PROGRESS

- In cryptography, a **nonce** (number once) is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication.

- A cryptographic key is called **ephemeral** if it is generated for each execution of a key establishment process. 

- **Threshold signatures** allow for splitting a private key into n secret shares. To sign a message, at least some threshold of the shareholders need to coordinate and provide their individual signatures using their share. These individual signatures combine to form a single valid signature.

- **Robust schemes** ensure that so long as t participants correctly follow the protocol, the protocol is guaranteed to complete successfully, even if a subset of participants (at most n âˆ’ t) contribute malformed shares.
